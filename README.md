# Web Scraping Project: Find All Instances of a Word

## Overview

This project is a web scraping script using Puppeteer, a headless browser automation tool, to find and locate all instances of a specified word on a website. It simulates user actions, such as navigating to a webpage, searching for the word, and handling infinite scroll to load more content if necessary.

## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/search-site-for-word-exercise.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd search-site-for-word-exercise
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the script, execute the following command:

```bash
node searchScript.js [urlOfTheWebsite] [wordToSearch]
```

Replace `[urlOfTheWebsite]` with site's url, and `[wordToSearch]` with the word you want to search for on the website.

## Example

```bash
node searchScript.js https://intoli.com/blog/scrape-infinite-scroll/demo.html Box
```

This will initiate the Puppeteer script to search for the word 'Box' on the specified website.

## Customization
- Modify launch options (headless or not) as it fits your needs
- Adjust the script to handle specific cases, such as different page structures or infinite scroll variations.

## Important Notes

- Respect the terms of service and policies of the target website.
- Be aware of legal and ethical considerations related to web scraping.
- Regularly check for updates to Puppeteer and make necessary adjustments to the script.
